## Contributing

We greatly value the feedback and contributions of our users. We have a simple process in place to facilitate this:

### Bugs and New Features

We keep a distinction between New Features and Bugs/Issues. We try to minimise the noise in our Github Issues stream by first having a conversation on [KOB! Whatsapp Group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/El6d3aAc6pYLEDEdQPVABY).

- User Issues can be raised in our issue section.
- New Features or Enhancements can be discussed in our issue section.

After accepting a new feature or confirming that a bug was found, an Issue may be raised filling in the provided Issue Template on the Kobman issue tracker.

**Unfortunately we will close any Github Issues that have not followed this process of prior discussion.**

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests are _always_ very welcome, but require the initial discussion on Whatsapp Group followed by a Github Issue as described above. The PR template is to be filled in before submission, ensuring that it is _linked back_ to the Github Issue number by replacing `#XXX` with the appropriate Issue reference.

Each PR should also be accompanied by a passing test(s) proving it's validity (where feasible). The feasibility of the test will emerge in the initial discussions on Slack and in the Github Issue.
